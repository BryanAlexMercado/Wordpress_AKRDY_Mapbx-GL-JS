Ok, so maybe not legendary but these have been hot sellers on the market over the last couple years. First, for their great durability and second for cost. They are excellent for Seward and Prince William Sound where snagging is permitted. A true Alaskan experience since there's not many other fisheries that allow snagging fish like Alaska. Great durability in the hook and plenty of weight to keep the hook down in the water where the salmon are. Snag for Kings, Silver, or Reds.
